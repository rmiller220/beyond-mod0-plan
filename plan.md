### My plan for success beyond Mod 0

## Routine for maintaining and growing skills

- Practice on codewars for 1 hour each day
- Spend 1 hour reading over our class materials from mod0 each day
- Practice/study short cut commands on www.shortcutfoo.com  
- Take free online course through Udemy to get more familiar with Ruby
- Keep in touch with my cohort mates by scheduling at least a once weeekly zoom meeting to check in on each other, while also giving us opportunities to continue to work in pairs.

## Keeping a healthy body and mind

- I will be doing yoga every morning when I wake up and at night before I go to bed. I have noticed that sitting in a chair for 12+ hours a day is hard on both my mind and body. I want to keep both as fresh as possible.
- Dedicate time to spend with my 4 year old son. This will improve my mood and also give me a reminder of my motivation for starting this program and my determination to complete it. I want to provide the best life I can for me and my family. 
- Continue prepping meals at the beginning of the week to eliminate etra work during the week.
- Find healthy snacks to eat while working to provide good clean energy.
-  Plan ahead and make sure to reschedule any doctor appointment that falls during a school week. Schedule any future appointments during break weeks. 

## New strategies to try

- Set a timer when doing an activity. It is easy to lose a lot of time stuck. 
- Make my desk environment more comfortable by finding a new computer chair, new desk, and another monitor. 
- Reflect on my work. Review areas that can be improved. Find shortcuts that increase my efficiency while working.
